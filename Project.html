        <h2><strong>Grade Evaluation System using Python</strong></h2><br>
        <p>
          The Grade Evaluation System, developed in Python, analyzes students' exam marks to assess their performance. Students are categorized as "Pass," "Fail," or "Defer" based on predefined rules. These rules consider total marks, which are evaluated in multiples of 20, with a maximum possible score of 120. The system calculates each student's total marks across all exams and assigns the appropriate category accordingly. For example, students scoring between 100 and 120 are labeled "Pass" for excellent performance, while those scoring between 80 and 100 also receive a "Pass" for satisfactory performance.<br><br>
